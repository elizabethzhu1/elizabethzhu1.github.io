On top of my studies at Stanford, here's a glimpse of what I'm doing in my spare time.

As of this quarter, I am embarking on a research project at Stanford's Computation and Cognition Lab.

I'm also working as a research assistant for the **[AI Index](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/)**, which is a project affiliated with the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). We recently published the 2023 AI Index, which can be read at the link above.

I'm also working as a pre-production researcher for **[Philosophy Talk](https://www.philosophytalk.org/)**, where I develop new ideas for shows and write up research packets for the hosts.\
\
In Winter 2023, I was a Course Assistant for **PHIL 20N: Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence @ Stanford**, taught by John Etchemendy.\
\
In the summer of 2021, I did research with the **Stanford Centre on Poverty and Inequality**, investigating AI companions as a solution to address the worsening adolescent mental health crisis.\


Some other things:
1. I wrote a piece in The Daily called ["The Dangers of Techno-Optimism"](https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/29/opinion-the-dangers-of-techno-optimism/). It's my only piece, but it was a fun one to write.
2. Every year, I run a philosophy journal for high school students called **[Dialexicon](https://www.dialexicon.org/)**. This is the journal's third year and we're in the process of publishing the journal.
3. Been reading *Coders* by Clive Thompson and *On the Road* by Jack Kerouac.
4. I should blog more.
