On top of my studies at Stanford, here's a glimpse of what I'm doing in my spare time.

This summer, I'm working as a software engineer at the startup **[Dex (YC S19)](https://getdex.com/)**.

Since spring, I've been doing research at the **[Stanford Computation and Cognition Lab](https://cocolab.stanford.edu)**. Our project explores whether Large Language Models can transmit cultural information.

I'm also a research assistant for the **[AI Index](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/)**, affiliated with **[Stanford HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu)**.

On a different front, I'm a pre-production researcher for **[Philosophy Talk](https://www.philosophytalk.org/)**, where I develop new ideas for shows and write up research packets for the hosts.

Current coursework: CS 161: Algorithms, PHIL 170: Ethical Theory, CS 193X: Web Programming, PHYSICS 43: E & M, and CS 195: Supervised Undergraduate Research

Some other things:
1. I wrote a piece in The Stanford Daily called ["The Dangers of Techno-Optimism"](https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/29/opinion-the-dangers-of-techno-optimism/).
2. Every year, I run a philosophy journal for high school students called **[Dialexicon](https://www.dialexicon.org/)**. This is the journal's third year and I'm thinking of remaking the site from scratch.
3. Been reading *Coders* by Clive Thompson and *On the Road* by Jack Kerouac.
4. I should blog more.
