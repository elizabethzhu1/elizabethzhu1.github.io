On top of my studies at Stanford, here's a glimpse of what I'm doing in my spare time.

This quarter, I'm doing research at the **[Stanford Computation and Cognition Lab](https://cocolab.stanford.edu)**.

I'm also working as a research assistant for the **[AI Index](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/)**, affiliated with **[Stanford HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu)**. We recently published the 2023 AI Index, which can be read at the above link.

On a different front, I'm a pre-production researcher for **[Philosophy Talk](https://www.philosophytalk.org/)**, where I develop new ideas for shows and write up research packets for the hosts.

In Winter 2023, I was a Course Assistant for **PHIL 20N: Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence @ Stanford**, taught by John Etchemendy.

In Summer 2021, I did research with the **Stanford Centre on Poverty and Inequality**, studying AI companions as a solution to address the adolescent mental health crisis.


Some other things:
1. I wrote a piece in The Daily called ["The Dangers of Techno-Optimism"](https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/29/opinion-the-dangers-of-techno-optimism/)!
2. Every year, I run a philosophy journal for high school students called **[Dialexicon](https://www.dialexicon.org/)**. This is the journal's third year and we're in the process of publishing the journal.
3. Been reading *Coders* by Clive Thompson and *On the Road* by Jack Kerouac!
4. I should blog more.
