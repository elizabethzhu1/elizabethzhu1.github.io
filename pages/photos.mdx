In addition to my studies at Stanford, I've had the good fortune to work on a few projects!

Currently, I'm working as a research assistant for the **[AI Index](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/)**, which is a project affiliated with the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

I'm also working as a pre-production researcher for **[Philosophy Talk](https://www.philosophytalk.org/)**, where I develop new ideas for shows and write up research packets for the hosts.\
\
Last summer, I did research with the **Stanford Centre on Poverty and Inequality**, studying AI companions as a solution to address the worsening adolescent mental health crisis.\
\
This Winter 2023 Quarter, I'm excited to be a Course Assistant for **PHIL 20N: Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence @ Stanford**, taught by John Etchemendy.

Some other highlights:
1. I wrote a piece in The Daily called ["The Dangers of Techno-Optimism"](https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/29/opinion-the-dangers-of-techno-optimism/). Take a read!
2. Every year, I run a philosophy journal for high school students called **[Dialexicon](https://www.dialexicon.org/)**. This is the journal's third year and we're currently accepting submissions. Tell your friends!
3. Been reading *Godel, Escher, Bach* and *I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings*. Great reads!
