### Hi, I'm Elizabeth Zhu.

I'm an undergraduate at Stanford studying computer science and philosophy.

My main interests lie in understanding how cognition works and how we can build ethical machines. Through my education, my hope is to take an interdisciplinary approach to these topics, taking courses on everything from ethical theory to algorithms.

Reach me at elizhu@stanford.edu. I would love to chat!
