## Hi, I'm Elizabeth Zhu.

I'm an undergraduate at Stanford studying **computer science** and **philosophy**.

My main interests lie in understanding how cognition works and building ethical machines. Through my education, my hope is to take an interdisciplinary approach to these topics, taking courses on everything from formal logic to moral philosophy to algorithms.

Reach me at elizhu@stanford.edu. I would love to chat!
